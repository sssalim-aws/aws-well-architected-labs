With the sample workload deployed in the workload account, you can now conduct an AWS Well-Architected Framework Review on it.
The purpose of the AWS Well-Architected Framework Review Exercise is to measure the alignment of your workload with the AWS Well-Architected Framework Best Practices. The review will identify areas for improvement that can be implemented in the workload to achieve better alignment.
To assist with the review process, AWS Well-Architected provides a tool to access information about best practices that can be used as a guide during conversations with workload stakeholders. The AWS Well-Architected tool provides insights into the configuration of AWS resources used in the workload by integrating with AWS Trusted Advisor checks. It also provides the capability to capture alignments and improvements over time.

In this section of the lab, you will prepare for an AWS Well-Architected Framework Review of the sample workload by creating a workload resource in the AWS Well-Architected tool and enabling Trusted Advisor check capabilities.
Please follow the steps below to proceed with the lab.

### 1.0. Provision IAM Role for Trusted Advisor in Workload Account.

The AWS Well-Architected Tool is designed to help you review the state of your applications and workloads against architectural best practices, identify opportunities for improvement, and track progress over time. When enabled, the Tool can retrieve data from Trusted Advisor periodically to provide you with data points around environment configuration during the review.

To view Trusted Advisor information, an IAM role needs to be created to provide access to the necessary API calls. And if you are running on multiple AWS accounts, this role must be created on each associated AWS account. You can refer to this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/activate-ta-in-iam.html) for details on which IAM permission to apply in the role.

In this lab, we’ve created a CloudFormation template to facilitate the creation of IAM role in the workload account. Follow the steps below to deploy the IAM roles into associated accounts. You will provision a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) StackSets that will deploy IAM Role with necessary permission policies for AWS WA Tool in Management Account to collect Trusted Advisor data in the member accounts where the workload has been deployed. 

1. Download the sample workload CloudFormation Template called **TrustedAdvisor_IAM_Role.yml** from [here](/watool/200_Accelerating_Well_Architected_Framework_Reviews_using_integrated_AWS_Trusted_Advisor_insights/Code/TrustedAdvisor_IAM_Role.yml).

2. Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.

3. Click on "StackSets" in the navigation pane and then click on "Create StackSet".

4. Under Specify template, select **Upload a template file** and upload the file you downloaded in step 1. Then Click on **Next**.

5. Specify `walab-wata-iam-role` as the **StackSet Name**.
   Under **ManagementAccount** specify the **Management Account ID**

6. Leave all settings as default and click **Next**.

7. Leave Execution configuration as **Inactive** then click **Next**.

8. In the **Deployment locations** section, select **Deploy to organizational units (OUs)** 

9. Under **AWS OU ID** enter in the Organizational Unit ID you captured in section 1 previously.

10. Specify the region you wish to deploy the workload to, Click **Next**, Click **Submit**

11. Wait until deployment is complete, and your Stack Operation status is **SUCCEEDED**

## 2.0 Create AWS Well-Architected Tool Workload.

In this section of the lab, you will create a workload in the AWS Well-Architected tool.  

The Well-Architected Framework Reviews are conducted per workload. A workload is a collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as a customer-facing application or a backend process. 
 
1. Search for Well-Architected Tool in the AWS console and click **Define workload** associated with the necessary AWS tags.

![Section2WATool](/watool/200_Accelerating_Well_Architected_Framework_Reviews_using_integrated_AWS_Trusted_Advisor_insights/Images/section2_tool.png)
 
2. Now you can [define a workload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/define-workload.html):
 
![Section2 DefiningAWorkload](/watool/200_Accelerating_Well_Architected_Framework_Reviews_using_integrated_AWS_Trusted_Advisor_insights/Images/section2_DefiningAWorkload.png)
 
The following are the required workload properties:
 
* workload-name - This is a unique identifier for the workload. Must be between 3 and 100 characters.
* description - A brief description of the workload. Must be between 3 and 250 characters.
* review-owner - The name, email address, or identifier for the primary individual or group that owns the review process. Must be between 3 and 255 characters.
* environment - The environment in which your workload runs. This must either be PRODUCTION or PREPRODUCTION
* aws-regions - The aws-regions in which your workload runs (us-east-1, etc).
* lenses - The list of lenses associated with the workload. All workloads must include the "wellarchitected" lens as a base, but can include additional lenses. 

3. Specify **workload account ID** created in Section 1 in the Account IDs field. This field is required to activate Trusted Advisor. 

4. To enable the integration with Trusted Advisor, after the necessary workload information has been entered, within the <b>AWS Trusted Advisor” section</b>, tick on <b>Activate Trusted Advisor</b>

![Enable Trusted Advisor](/watool/200_Accelerating_Well_Architected_Framework_Reviews_using_integrated_AWS_Trusted_Advisor_insights/Images/Enabling-the-Trusted-Advisor-feature.png)

5. Choose the lenses that apply to this workload. **AWS Well-Architected Framework** has been selected by default.

## Congratulations! 

You have defined a workload and enable Trusted Advisor to review.
